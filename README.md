The pourpose of this repository is to use algorithm challenges to improve some of my skills in typescript.

This is just me trying to learn more about Typescript i will use this approach with other languages too.

If you have some challenge that you think that maybe i can do, please let me know.

If you have some consideration that can improve my code skills, please contact me.
